So what (Day 2):
- Against a seasonal 4-week baseline, model reduces MAE by 24.7%.
- Top drivers: price, promo.
- Price partial shows expected negative slope; promo partial shows positive lift.
- Use seasonal baseline for safety stock; use model to prioritize promo/price cells.
- Next: add calendar features (holidays) and region segmentation for stability.
